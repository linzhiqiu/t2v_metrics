    "question": "Describe the camera movement in this video.",
    "reference": "The drone camera flies low over a desert, moving forward with a very smooth motion. As a racing car comes into view, the camera slightly rolls clockwise and pans right to follow the car, which kicks up a cloud of sand that momentarily obscures the lens. It then continues to follow the car, with the motion gradually transitioning into slow motion.",
    "gpt-4o": "The camera movement in the video appears dynamic and fast-paced. It starts with a forward movement through a desert landscape, likely using a tracking shot to create a sense of speed as it rushes toward a camel in front of a tent. The camera then swiftly moves past the tent, maintaining a lateral momentum that adds to the feeling of rapid motion.\n\nNext, there's a brief cut transitioning into a close-up shot where debris and sand are thrown into the air, likely indicating the presence of a vehicle or some forceful action nearby. The camera angle and movement emphasize the dynamic energy and speed of the scene, focusing on the dramatic effect of the flying sand and dirt.\n\nOverall, the camera movements combine swift transitions, tracking shots, and close-ups to enhance the sense of action and speed throughout the sequence."

    "reference": "The camera moves forward at a slight angle, tracking the skateboarder from a rear-side perspective. Around the middle of the video, it pans slightly to the left as the skateboarder moves slightly left, positioning himself in front of the camera. The camera is following the subject from behind, and during the tracking shot, the subject becomes larger in the frame. The camera movement is slightly unsteady with some shaking.",
    "gpt-4o": "The video depicts dynamic camera movement that follows a skateboarder. The camera is positioned close to the ground, moving alongside the skateboarder to capture the action smoothly. This technique provides an immersive view of the skateboarding action, maintaining a steady focus on the skater\u2019s movements. The motion likely includes some subtle panning and tracking to keep the skateboarder centered in the frame, creating an engaging and continuous perspective of the scene."

    "reference": "The camera initially frames two subjects before smoothly dollying backward and trucking leftward, incorporating a subtle counterclockwise roll. This movement gradually reveals a group photo of four subjects, starting slowly and accelerating as the video progresses, all while maintaining a very smooth and steady motion without any shaking.",
    "gpt-4o": "I can't view videos, but based on the images provided, it looks like a pan from right to left, revealing multiple characters in an illustrated scene."

It maintains a consistent distance and angle, keeping the truck centered in the frame while capturing the surrounding landscape. The camera appears to be panning slightly to maintain the truck in focus as it moves forward."
