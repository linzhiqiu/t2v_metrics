"""
This file contains all code necessary for text data loading from preshuffled jsonl chunks.
For example if given the following files with a world size of 8

/path/to/arxiv:
arxiv.chunk.00.jsonl (Contains many lines of {"text":...} or {"content":...})
arxiv.chunk.01.jsonl
arxiv.chunk.02.jsonl
arxiv.chunk.03.jsonl

/path/to/wikipedia:
wikipedia.chunk.00.jsonl
wikipedia.chunk.01.jsonl
wikipedia.chunk.02.jsonl
wikipedia.chunk.03.jsonl

Step (1) => infinite_block_jsonl_iterator
2 workers will read each jsonl chunk (world_size = 8 distributed over 4 workers) from each source.
Each worker will read 1 line and skip the next, therefore workers on the same file read in an interleaved manner.

Step (2) => multi_choice_iterator
At every iteration, a source is sampled randomly given some weights

Step (3) => tokenizer and pack_tokens
Reads sequences until reaching seq_len tokens and yields a numpy array of shape (seq_len, n_views)

Step (4) => prefetch_data_loader
Prefetches batches in advance and shuffles them to reduce correlation, yields a numpy array of shape (batch_size, seq_len, n_views)

This create a nested iterator structure where each iterator is responsible for a specific task:
    [ [ [ [ [ (1) read document ] -> (2) sample source ] -> (3) tokenize ] -> (4) tokenize and build sequence of fixed seq_len ] -> (5) prefetch batches ]

Each iterator returns a tuple (output, state) where state contains all the info necessary to resume from the last output.

build_mixed_token_packing_dataloader creates the states and return an iterator that does everything above

build_seperate_token_packing_dataloader does the same thing but swaps step 2 and 3

Both can be called with a resume_state to resume from any given position deterministically
